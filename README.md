## Introduction

Welcome to Campus Callouts! This callout pack brings the dynamic world of college campus policing to LSPDFR.  
From peaceful protests that could go south, to bizarre clown sightings and serious emergencies, this pack aims to be immersive, entertaining, and unique every time you play.

This is my first major release under Seerside Studios for LSPDFR, and I'm beyond excited to finally share it with the community.  
Each callout is crafted with research, time, and just the right amount of unpredictability.
