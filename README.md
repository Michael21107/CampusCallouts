## CampusCallouts.ini Configuration

Inside the `plugins > LSPDFR` folder, you'll find `CampusCallouts.ini`.

You can use this file to:
- Change your **dialogue key**
- Toggle **Blueline Audio** support
- Enable or disable individual **callouts**

### `UseBluelineDispatchAudio`
Set to `True` only if you're using **Blueline Dispatch**. This enables support for its custom audio lines. Otherwise, leave it `False`.

## About Seerside Studios

Hi! I'm the solo developer behind Seerside Studios. I started my journey in VR modding with **Blade and Sorcery**, which gained nearly **70,000 unique downloads**. Now, I’m diving into GTA V modding with the same energy and passion.

**Campus Callouts** is my first LSPDFR mod, and also my intro to C# development — my background was originally in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS!
