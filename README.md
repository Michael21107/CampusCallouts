## Introduction
Welcome to **Campus Callouts!** This callout pack brings the dynamic, chaotic, and sometimes hilarious world of college campus policing to LSPDFR. From peaceful protests that could go south, to bizarre clown sightings and serious emergencies, this pack aims to be immersive, entertaining, and unique every time you play.

This is my first major release under Seerside Studios for LSPDFR, and I'm beyond excited to finally share it with the community! Each callout is crafted with research, time, and just the right amount of unpredictability.

## Updating Campus Callouts
To update from a previous version of Campus Callouts:

1. Backup your `CampusCallouts.ini` file if you've made custom changes.  
2. Delete the old `CampusCallouts - Audio` folder inside `LSPDFR/Audio/Scanner/`.  
   - _This is important! Some older audio files may no longer be used in newer versions._  
3. Drag and drop the new files (including the updated `lspdfr` and `plugins` folders and any external `.dll` files) into your GTA V root directory.  
4. Replace files when prompted.  
5. Launch the game.

## Troubleshooting Protest Callout
The **Protest on Campus** callout uses background protest audio that plays in a loop using **NAudio**. If the music doesnâ€™t play or your game crashes at the scene, here are a few things to check:

1. Make sure youâ€™ve included **NAudio.dll** in your `plugins` folder.  
   - Without this, music playback won't function and may cause issues.  
2. Confirm the protest music file is present.  
   - It should be located at: `LSPDFR/Audio/Scanner/CampusCallouts - Audio/Protest/CC_PROTEST_AUDIO.wav`  
   - If this file is missing, the protest scene will still function but no background music will play.  
3. Ensure you're not manually deleting or moving any NAudio dependencies.

## How to Use
Once youâ€™re on duty in LSPDFR, Campus Callouts will load automatically!

Callouts can be triggered by the game, or started manually using a callout manager or the console:  
**Press F4 and type:** `StartCallout CalloutName`  

---

## CampusCallouts.ini Configuration
The `CampusCallouts.ini` file is located inside `plugins > LSPDFR`. You can:

- Adjust your dialogue key  
- Enable or disable specific audio packages  
- Enable or disable callouts  

**UseBluelineDispatchAudio**  
Only enable this (set to `True`) if you use Blueline Dispatch. Otherwise, leave it `False` to avoid missing audio.
