Introduction
Welcome to Campus Callouts! This callout pack brings the dynamic, chaotic, and sometimes hilarious world of college campus policing to LSPDFR. From peaceful protests that could go south, to bizarre clown sightings and serious emergencies, this pack aims to be immersive, entertaining, and unique every time you play.

This is my first major release under Seerside Studios for LSPDFR, and I'm beyond excited to finally share it with the community! Each callout is crafted with research, time, and just the right amount of unpredictability.

•	Latest and legal copy of Grand Theft Auto V 
•	LSPDFR 0.4.9 or newer
•	Latest version of RagePluginHook 
•	CalloutInterfaceAPI.dll (included in the download)
•	NAudio.dll (included in the download) – Required for callout music 
Integrations
• StopThePed – For managing traffic, arrests, and AI behavior
• Callout Interface – Enables immersive MDT pop-ups and tracking during active callouts
• Blueline Dispatch (Optional) – Enables immersive dispatch audio lines (see INI instructions)
Installation

2. Drag the 'lspdfr' and 'plugins' folders directly into your GTA V main directory.
3. Allow file replacement if prompted.
4. Launch GTA V via RagePluginHook and go on duty to begin receiving callouts.

Updating Campus Callouts
To update from a previous version of Campus Callouts:
1. Backup your CampusCallouts.ini file if you've made custom changes.

   • This is important! Some older audio files may no longer be used in newer versions.
3. Drag and drop the new files (including the updated `lspdfr` and `plugins` folders and any external .dll files) into your GTA V root directory.
4. Replace files when prompted.
5. Launch the game
Callout Overview
Campus Callouts includes 15 fully scripted, immersive scenarios designed to make you feel like you’re in a university environment:
Drone Use: Reports of unauthorized drone activity over the campus quad. Investigate suspicious UAV behavior, interview bystanders, and track down the drone operator.
Fight: Two students have been reported physically fighting outside a lecture hall. Respond quickly to break up the altercation and deescalate the scene. (Adapted from University Callouts)
Hit and Run: A student has been struck near a parked vehicle on campus. Question witnesses, search for the suspect vehicle, and determine if the driver intentionally fled.
Noise Complaint: Neighbors have reported excessively loud music and parties from a student dorm. Evaluate whether the situation is just a party or something more. (Adapted from University Callouts)
Stalking: A concerned student believes they are being followed by someone on campus. Meet with the victim, gather intel, and identify the suspect. (Adapted from University Callouts)
Student Escort: You’ve been asked to escort a vulnerable student across campus safely. The situation may escalate or resolve peacefully. (Adapted from University Callouts)
Trespasser: Security has reported an unknown individual wandering around restricted school grounds. Locate and confront the subject.
Underage Drinking: There are reports of alcohol being served at an unsanctioned student gathering. Confirm IDs and manage the situation responsibly. (Adapted from University Callouts)
Vandalism: Graffiti or damage has been reported at a campus landmark. Investigate the scene and pursue possible suspects.
Weapon Violation: A student has been spotted brandishing a weapon near the gymnasium. Respond cautiously and with backup. (Adapted from University Callouts)
Intoxicated Student: A student appears heavily intoxicated and disoriented. Provide medical assistance or determine if an arrest is necessary.
Protest on Campus: A growing student protest is unfolding. Depending on how things develop, the protest may turn violent, or you may be asked to escort the dean to safety.
Killer Clown 911 Call: A disturbing call has come in about an aggressive clown seen lurking near campus buildings. Respond immediately and expect danger.
Missing Person: A student has been reported missing. Speak with their roommate, follow a series of leads, and explore multiple locations across the city to find them.
School Shooter: A critical threat scenario. An armed suspect has been reported inside a school building. This is a high-risk response situation.
How to Use
Once you’re on duty in LSPDFR, Campus Callouts will load automatically!

Callouts can be triggered by the game, or started manually using a callout manager or the console:
Press F4 and type: StartCallout CalloutName
CampusCallouts.ini Configuration
You can find the CampusCallouts.ini file inside plugins > LSPDFR.

Inside, you’ll find options to:
• Adjust your dialogue key
• Enable or disable specific audio packages
• Enable or disable callouts

UseBluelineDispatchAudio 
ONLY enable this (set to True) if you use Blueline Dispatch. This will trigger audio that references Blueline Audio files. If you don’t use it, leave it False to avoid missing audio.
